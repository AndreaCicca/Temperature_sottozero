# Below-zero
A program that reads from std input a sequence of n x 4 real numbers (0 ≤ n ≤ 365), which represent the temperatures measured in a given place every 6 hours for n days of the year, and there stores (obligatorily) in a matrix T of size n x 4. The data entry ends as soon as a number greater than or equal to 100 is provided.
